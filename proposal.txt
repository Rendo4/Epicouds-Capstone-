Intial Ideas and thoughts to excute:
 I began by watching a series of youtube videos. Here is one that I found particularly helpful in identifying the struggles of intially planning as a beginner:

 My desire is to create something useful for me esports tournament and production buisness to automate processes for me. With that these are the issues i'm facing and if I can solve
 either in this capstone presentation or later I can build upon. 
  *Automate Lock-in procedure
  *Create Esports Stats for teams
  *Feature: Play-off Pick'ems
  *Feature: Fantasy Draft

  Lock-ins:
  Issue: Currently team capatins are expected to tag a T.O in a discord channel with who is playing in their match the following day to allow teams time to prepare. The T.Os 
  then have to update a public google sheet at a late hour. 
  Feature should:
  *asaign roles to allow a team captain to only change his teams roster
  * update an object with information given to it by user input
  * Identitfy the time and release information at a pre - determined time with team lock in information
  * information can be released into a web page, update to a google spreedsheet, or into a discord channel

  Possible routes:
  Create an MVC project with Entity Authentication 
  Create a Raect app with Firebase
  Discord bot? 

  Need to learn:
  *Asaign user roles(player, captain, adminstraitor) 
  * Auto updates to change an object at pre determined time


Create Esports Stats for team:
issue: Our stats are being tracked on a google spreedsheet. It doesn't give us space for cool images or manipulation of a dom to create unique player profiles or account for mutiple seasons of stats

Feature Should: 
*Hold data for mutiple seasons
*Have a break down by seasons
    -unique champions
    -KDA
    -teams played on
*Easy ways to querry the data for teams or indvidual players (Many to Many?)
*Custom CSS to appeal to players
*allow adminstraitor to input more data as seasons are played

Possible routes: 
MVC project with Many to Many SQL database.
React with Firebase (Would this be a lot of hard coded data?) 
React with SQL database

Need to learn:
*Custom hooks to query search and manipulated pulled date from SQL database in React
*Best format on Many to Many relationships

Play-Offs Pickems:
Issue: None but it would be cool to emmulate the worlds experiece where players can try to predict many factors of the competitive season. 

Feature should:
Have mutiple selection boxes for questions
  *Who will win matches
  *Most played
  *Most banned
  *Baron steals
  *Penta kill #/champions
Should lock after a certain Date and time
Should Update as the play offs progress and award points
*strectch goal: Leaderboard

Possible Routes:
*MVC doesn't seem as nessary
*object orentiated programming with simple if User.Input = Playoffs.Result, User.Score + Score
*React with Firebase

Need to learn:
Closing a feature such as a form or edit at a certain date and time
Creating a list of users and filtering by User.Score 


Feature: Fantasy Draft
Issue: No Issue but it would be cool if players could be drafted similar to fantasy football. 

Feature should:
*Allow users to draft from active players in a season
*Open draft incident and then closer once teams are done
*Update a players score for a week depending on their stats in the previous feature
*Randomize a fantasy league schedule based off users in a instance
*Keep score and update based off time and date features
*Allow users to trade players after the draft has happend or trade with none drafted players

Possible Routes:
React with MYSQL seems the most likey as it build off a previous features.

Need to learn:
*Date and time features to lock features
*Create obejects of Users, Teams, Schedule, and Season scores to player scores
